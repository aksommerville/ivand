# One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich: The Video Game

## Rules

- Walk left and right, A to jump (say 2 tiles high?)
- Your position always comes to rest at tile intervals.
- Without shovel, B to pick up the thing below you or drop what you're carrying.
- With shovel, B to dig one tile of earth or deposit the tile's worth you're carrying.
- Stand in front of shovel and press Down to pick up, or Down while holding it to drop it there.
- World begins flat.
- World loops horizontally (say 5 screens wide?).
- World extends vertically far enough that nobody should reach the edge.
- Begin with a Stalin statue resting at ground level.
- Whenever the Stalin statue is not the tallest thing, a warning sounds and guards will shoot you.
- ~Game over if you get shot.~ Hit points, say 5?
- Each round is timed, say 2 minutes?
- End of round, your score is the lowest depth times the highest elevation times hit points.
- - ie if you don't dig at all, or don't build at all, or get killed, no points.
- - Also no points if the statue is not the highest thing, we don't give points to Enemies Of The State.
- Radioactive waste! It appears midway through the game and you must bury it in the deepest hole.
